        <!-- Disadvantages of Swimming -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Disadvantages of Swimming</h2>
            <p>Despite its many benefits, swimming has some potential drawbacks that should be considered. Here are some of the most common disadvantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk of Infections:</strong> Swimming in public pools or natural bodies of water can expose you to bacteria and viruses. It's important to maintain proper hygiene and avoid swimming in contaminated water.</li>
                <li><strong>Skin and Hair Damage:</strong> Prolonged exposure to chlorine in swimming pools can dry out your skin and hair, leading to irritation and damage. It’s recommended to rinse off after swimming and use hair and skin care products that protect against chlorine.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk of Injury:</strong> Incorrect swimming techniques or overexertion can lead to injuries such as shoulder strains, back pain, or muscle cramps. It's important to learn the proper form and listen to your body.</li>
                <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Swimming for extended periods of time without hydrating can cause dehydration. It's important to drink water before, during, and after swimming, especially in warm environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Time and Access:</strong> For some people, swimming requires access to a pool or a safe swimming area, which may not always be convenient. It can also be time-consuming to travel to a suitable location.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although these disadvantages are manageable, it’s essential to be aware of them to ensure a safe and enjoyable swimming experience.</p>
